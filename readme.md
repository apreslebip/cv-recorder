## Knob recorder :v:
:warning: **UNDER DEV ARDUINO CODE**


As you push a **button**, you can move the pot and it will record your movements for some time... As soon as you release the **button**, **out** give a loop of the recorded CV.
A clock in **reset** will reset the loop.


I did mine 1u. I'll post pics.
