## 2 channel CV recorder :v:

:warning: under development

Arduino code.

As you push a **button** (REC A or REC B), you can move the pot and it record it. As soon as you release the **button**, **out** give the CV recorder.

It has 2 channels with each one out and one button.

I did mine 1u. I'll post pics.
